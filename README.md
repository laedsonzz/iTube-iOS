# iTube

<img src="/template.PNG" >

Written in Python, iTube is an application created using Pythonista 3, with the aim of meeting my personal needs.

# Functions

- Download videos and music individually.
- Download YouTube playlists (songs and videos).

For now, only in standard MP3 and MP4 formats.

# Requirements

- iPhone with [Pythonista 3](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097) installed **(on the iPad it will work, but I'm not sure if the dimensions will be correct, you can tweak it in the code if it fails :D)**
- [StaSh](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) is a shell for Pythonista, it will be used to download Python dependencies with pip.
- [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) it is the only dependency needed to use the app.

# Installation

- **Step 1:** Start StaSh and in the terminal type: "pip install pytube" without the quotes.
- **Step 2:** Download the iTube.v0.1.zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/laedsonzz/iTube-iOS/releases/tag/iTube-iOS) then extract.
- **Step 3:** Import the project into Pythonista 3

Okay, now just start using the iTube.py script (I recommend adding a shortcut to the home screen, read Pythonista's documentation for more information).
